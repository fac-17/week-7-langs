# Week 7 - LANGs

## Team
Georgia 
Gigi
Gregor
Sarah
and sometimes Sam

## Code of conduct
* We need to hold Jack to talk when discussing 🐱
* Start fresh :)
* Group learning 🏘️: When something has to be explained/clarified, we all regroup to explain -> everyone understand roughly the whole project (global)
* Let's agree just before pairing how we want to proceede
* Swap pairs every 1:30 and be careful about everyone is coding
* We are all together in this group, so we care about each other and don't leave anyone behind
* Be careful with the commits
* Be kind to each other
* Be mindful when explaining - everyone likes to be taught/explained to in different ways
* Engage in pull requests/code review
* Test your code as you go - TDD

## Installation

To start the project :

`npm install`

To run the project on the localhost:3000:

`npm start` in your shell 🐚

## Project goals ⚽
- [x] Login form with 2 fields - username and password
- [ ] Users only have to log in once (i.e. implement a cookie-based session on login)
- [ ] Username is visible on each page of the site after logging in
- [ ] Any user-submitted content should be labelled with the authors username
- [ ] There should be protected routes and unprotected routes that depend on the user having a cookie or not (or what level of access they have).
- [x] Website content should be stored in a database
- [ ] Include thorough tests on the back-end, testing pure functions and testing routes using Supertest. If you make external API calls, use Nock to mock the response for your tests.
- [ ] Test front-end logic, we don't expect tests on the DOM.

## Project stretch goals 🎯
- [ ] Client-side and server-side validation on login form, including error handling that provides feedback to users
- [ ] Add roles and permissions - Have an "admin" level user (role) who can edit and delete all content 😱 (permissions)
- [ ] Add comment functionality to content
- [ ] Add like functionality to content
- [ ] Allow users to delete the content that they have submitted

## What's gone well 🤗
* We have communicated much better this week! We have made sure to nip any problems in the bud and listen to each other more than we talk.
* Code review - we've made an active effort to not just merge pull requests, but to inspect the changed code in each file that's changed, and question each other on the changes. This has meant that our code is more organised and there are less bugs. 

## What could have gone better 😔
* While we all agreed to start from stratch and not build on the project we did last week like other groups have done, this has obviously slowed us down a bit because of time spent building file architecture, the server, deploying, setting up continuous integration and building a database. BUT on the plus side, we have consolidated these skills and have also made it into the authentication side of the project, too.

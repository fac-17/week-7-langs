# Week 7 - LANGs

## Team
Georgia, Gigi, Gregor, Sam, Sarah

## Code of conduct
* We need to hold Jack to talk when discussing
* Start fresh :)
* Group learning : When something has to be explained/clarified, we all regroup to explain -> everyone understand roughly the whole project (global)
* Let's agree just before pairing how we want to proceede
* Swap pairs every 1:30 and be careful about everyone is coding
* We are all together in this group, so we care about each other and don't leave anyone behind
* Be careful with the commits
* Be kind to each other
* Be mindful when explaining - everyone likes to be taught/explained to in different ways
* Engage in pull requests/code review
* Test your code as you go - TDD

- [x] file structure
    - [x] public
        - [ ] establish an html file (boilerplate)
        - [ ] CSS file
        - [ ] dom.js
    - [ ] SRC:
        - [ ] server.js

- [ ] pic dependencies
- [ ] basic html

- [ ] Register a new user:
    - [ ] form -> client validation -> index.html
    - [ ] dom.js -> do request to back end -> handler.js
    - [ ] handler.js -> check database (getData) -> compare user registration
    - [ ] IF: user name is on database -> error handler = response to front ('user already exist')
    - [ ] IF: user doesn't exist -> hashed password -> register in database


- [ ] Login/signing a user:
    - [ ] form -> client validation -> index.html
    - [ ] check if the name is matching with a user from the database
        - [ ] IF match:
            - [ ] hash password
            - [ ] compare hashedpassword with the hashedpassword of database

                    - [ ] Do something -> index.html/dom.js

### Thursday AM 
- [ ] give user token inside a cookie on successful log in and redirect to mystery page
- [ ] show sign up page if user attempts to enter mystery page without signing in

### Thursday PM
- [ ] 
- [ ] Spend an hour on our readme (5-6pm)



## Project goals
- [ ] Login form with 2 fields - username and password
- [ ] Users only have to log in once (i.e. implement a cookie-based session on login)
- [ ] Username is visible on each page of the site after logging in
- [ ] Any user-submitted content should be labelled with the authors username
- [ ] There should be protected routes and unprotected routes that depend on the user having a cookie or not (or what level of access they have).
- [ ] Website content should be stored in a database
- [ ] Include thorough tests on the back-end, testing pure functions and testing routes using Supertest. If you make external API calls, use Nock to mock the response for your tests.
- [ ] Test front-end logic, we don't expect tests on the DOM.

## Project stretch goals
- [ ] Client-side and server-side validation on login form, including error handling that provides feedback to users
- [ ] Add roles and permissions - Have an "admin" level user (role) who can edit and delete all content ðŸ˜± (permissions)
- [ ] Add comment functionality to content
- [ ] Add like functionality to content
- [ ] Allow users to delete the content that they have submitted

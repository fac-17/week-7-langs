## What's gone well ðŸ¤—
* We have communicated much better this week! We have made sure to nip any problems in the bud and listen to each other more than we talk.

---

* Code review - we've made an active effort to not just merge pull requests, but to inspect the changed code in each file that's changed, and question each other on the changes. This has meant that our code is more organised and there are less bugs. 

---

* We were really good at making sure we get equal amounts of commits - even if our insights suggest otherwise.
* And swapping pairs regularly!

---

* We said we'd focus on developing our skills and not a sick website and we've stuck to that.

---

## What we could have done better

---

* Kept last week's project - move onto cookies/authentication faster and no lengthy setting up.

---

## What we'd add if we had a bit more time

---

* A log out button.
* More than just a gif on the about page.
* An even better user experience.
* DB Testing
